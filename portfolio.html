                    <br><br>
                    <mark>The Umbro Velocita IV is designed for those who value creativity and flair in their game. With such a dynamic and sleek boot, we decided to give it a campaign that is as inventive as the players that use it.</mark>
                    <br><br>
                    <mark>The possibilities are endless with a pair of Velocita IVs on your feet, so our photographs for Umbro are as well.</mark>

                    (UX & UI DESIGN / ART DIRECTION / WEB DESIGN / DIGITAL STRATEGY)</mark>
                <br> <br>
                <mark>I was brought on board at GPB in part to spearhead a complete website redesign as we migrate from Drupal 7 CMS to Drupal 8. This afforded an incredible opportunity to rethink how our design and branding best serves our dedicated viewership.</mark>
                <br><br>
                <mark>The biggest part of my work at GPB goes beyond designing brand packages and building websites - as the sole designer on the Digital team, it’s my responsiblity to lead and innovate how we think about a broadcast and content product that is more digital-first every day. This included a rebuild of our GPB App, allowing us to connect with our audience across Georgia on their terms.</mark>
                <br><br>
                <mark>Public media rocks! I also fufilled a longstanding goal and met Richard Trethewey, the Plumbing Expert from This Old House, but that’s a story for a different deck.</mark></div>

                    (ART DIRECTION / PHOTOGRAPHY / PRINT CAMPAIGN)</mark>
                <br><br>
                <mark>The Willie Nelson & Friends Museum has an advertising problem. Located far from the most popular stretches of Broadway in Downtown Nashville, Tennessee, the Museum is at a disadvantage when it comes to getting country music fans in the door.</mark>
                <br><br>
                <mark>Our solution was to design a print campaign based upon the very things that make the Museum such a unique and underrated Nashville institution. Using Willie’s persona of the “Red-Headed Stranger” as our cue, we featured impersonators of country music icons (Willie, Dolly, and Johnny) as a playful way to make y’all familiar with the Museum.</mark>

                <br><br>
                <mark>The best hometown bar in the world deserves the best hometown design in the world. We worked with the famous Stagger Inn...Again in Edwardsville, Illinois to design a logo derived from the bar’s decades-old wooden sign, and create a website that invokes The Stagger’s playful, welcoming atmosphere. Stagger in and stay awhile!</mark>
